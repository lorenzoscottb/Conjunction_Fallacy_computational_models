# Corpus-Based Approach to Conjunction Fallacy
This repository contains the code for my master's thesis

Abstract: 

Text-Corpus-based approaches from domains such as computational linguistics or natural language processing have found many application in various areas of cognitive science, psychology and, more recently, even neuroscience. Given the robust success that these methods had with simpler experimental phenomena, such as words-similarity or words- frequency judgments, authors have adopted always more complicated tests, form domains such as psycholinguistics and experimental psychology, to test the efficiency of these techniques. In recent days, the intriguing paradigm of the conjunction fallacy draw the attention of some of these authors, which have tried to tackle the problem both with a linguistics and a confirmation-measures oriented computational approach, with techniques from the flouring domain of distributional semantics, and co-occurrences method. Our work, that represent a comparison and expansion of some of these previous works, confirms the observed predictive power of most of approaches, yet raised some doubts on their descriptive power.
